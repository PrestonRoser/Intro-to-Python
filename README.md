# Intro to Python – Mini Projects

This repository serves as a **learning log and project archive** documenting my progression while learning Python fundamentals. Each mini-project focuses on a specific concept or skill, implemented as a standalone script.

The goal of this repo is not to present production-ready software, but to **demonstrate learning velocity, problem-solving, and core Python competency** through small, complete programs.
